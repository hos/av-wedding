  "welcome": "Dear friends! 💌\n\nAs you know, the two most wonderful and very dear to us people are getting married soon, and our small Yerevan commune decided to organize a collective gift for the newlyweds.\n\n \n\n📖 It is very important for the couple to have their loved ones share this special day with them. To help them remember it, we want to put together a wedding photo album, which we'd like to create together with you. \n\nEven if you cannot come to the wedding, please consider joining!\n\n \n\n💸 We also decided to organize a fundraiser (for a soon-to-be honeymoon, hopefully 🤞) and share this opportunity with those who have also been struggling with the eternal question of *What to give as a wedding gift when there are no instructions on what to give as a wedding gift*. \n\n**It is important to note that they really do not expect any presents; the website says, *Your presence is the best present.*, and they mean it! \n\nSo please do not feel pressured by our (totally unnecessary) enthusiasm!** 🥂\n\n \n\nWe've set up this bot to make it convenient for anyone who'd like to join. There is absolutely no obligation — please only participate if you wish to. We will pass the gift to the boys on their wedding day. 💛\n\nIf you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to reach out to @marumara — happy to help!\n\nThank you! 🎉",
